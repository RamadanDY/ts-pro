So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation.

TypeScript uses compile time type checking.

Which means it checks if the specified types match before running the code, not while running the code.


>>>>>How do I use TypeScript?
A common way to use TypeScript is to use the official TypeScript compiler, which transpiles TypeScript code into JavaScript.

The next section shows how to get the compiler setup for a local project.

Some popular code editors, such as Visual Studio Code, have built-in TypeScript support and can show errors as you write code!

Within your npm project, run the following command to install the compiler:

****npm install typescript --save-dev

The compiler is installed in the node_modules directory and can be run with: npx tsc.

*****npx tsc


Configuring the compiler
By default the TypeScript compiler will print a help message when run in an empty project.

The compiler can be configured using a tsconfig.json file.

You can have TypeScript create tsconfig.json with the recommended settings with:

Example
npx tsc --init
